  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <div class="history-content collapsed">

  <p>
    Since its founding in 1965, Kigumo Bendera High School has remained a beacon of academic excellence and character development. Over the decades, the school has produced credible, educated Kenyans who have gone on to serve the country with distinction in fields such as medicine, law, engineering, education, economics, and science.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The school has evolved alongside Kenya‚Äôs educational systems, offering the E.A.C.E curriculum in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by K.C.E and K.A.C.E up to 1989, and currently the K.C.S.E. This adaptability reflects KBHS‚Äôs commitment to staying at the forefront of academic progress.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We honor the founding fathers whose vision laid the foundation for this institution. Senior Chief Apollo Mwangi, the first Chairman of the school management board, and Mr. Naftari Mwangi, the longest-serving Chairman (1967‚Äì1985), were instrumental in shaping the school‚Äôs direction. Their legacy was carried forward by leaders like Mr. Solomon Karanja, Mr. Samuel Munyoro, and Mr. Wilson Waithaka.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The school‚Äôs spiritual and moral compass has been guided by its sponsor, the ACC & S Church, which has stood by KBHS through the years. Their support has helped nurture a community rooted in values and purpose.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We also salute the many dedicated teachers who have shaped generations of students. Among them are Mr. D.K. Kariuki (1977‚Äì1989), Ms. Susan Muthoni Kariuki (1998‚Äì2020), Joanina Mugechi Njora (1998‚Äì2023), and Mr. Stephen Wathigo Gathia (2001‚Äì2023). Their tireless efforts have led countless students to universities and colleges across the country.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In 2023, KBHS achieved a remarkable academic milestone, improving its KCSE mean score from 4.5 to 5.9. The number of students attaining C+ and above rose from 15 to 60‚Äîa testament to the school‚Äôs renewed focus on excellence.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beyond academics, KBHS has excelled in co-curricular activities. Our football team reached the national level, while handball, basketball, and rugby have consistently dominated Murang‚Äôa County. In the Science & Engineering Fair, our students have taken projects to the national stage for two consecutive years, with four projects qualifying in 2024‚Äîearning KBHS the trophy for the highest number of national entries.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We extend heartfelt gratitude to all stakeholders‚Äîstudents, teachers, parents, alumni, the sponsor church, the Board of Management, support staff, the Ministry of Education, and the local community. Your collective efforts continue to shape KBHS into one of Kenya‚Äôs most respected institutions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    May every stakeholder endeavor to make Kigumo Bendera High School the best in this region, if not the entire country. Strive for victory.
